# Adaptive Variational Continual Learning via Task-Heuristic Modelling

## Overview

This repository hosts the project **Adaptive Variational Continual Learning via Task-Heuristic Modelling**. The project aims to develop a self-balancing Variational Continual Learning (VCL) framework that adapts to new tasks using heuristic modeling.

## Results

The root directory contains notebooks designed to reproduce the relevant original VCL results (`vcl_reproduce.ipynb`) and to facilitate further exploration of a self-balancing Variational Continual Learning framework (`autovcl_experiment.ipynb`). If the images are not properly rendered in the notebooks, please refer to the two PDF documents located in `results/pdf`.

## Installation

To install the necessary dependencies, run the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To run the experiments, use the following notebooks:

### Notebooks

- **vcl_reproduce.ipynb**: Reproduces the original Variational Continual Learning (VCL) results.
- **autovcl_experiment.ipynb**: Explores the self-balancing Variational Continual Learning framework.
